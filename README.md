Navigating the sea of publications

##Installation

1. Git clone this repository.
2. In order to enable this in chrome, you need to open Chrome Settings > Extensions. Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'. Select the `build` folder from within this repository. 
3. Go to any page, and click on the icon in the search bar. To see best results, click the icon while looking at a pdf. 

### Developer Installation

You will need to install [node](http://nodejs.org/). This will come with npm preinstalled. Once you have cloned the folder, following the first step above, run `npm install`. 

When you have edited `main.js` or any dependency of it, run:

`gulp`.

This will set up a watcher on the code - when you make changes, it will reflect those changes in `build`, which you need to manually refresh from the Chrome Extensions page. Once 'default' has finished, you should cancel out it by pressing Ctrl+C. 

Let us know what else you'd need to do here, I suspect there is more. 

This will ensure that everything is compiled into bundle.js. You may need to run `npm install browserify -g` first. After it states `default done`, go to the Chrome Extensions page, and refresh it. Refresh the page your .pdf or browser is loaded on before clicking the Beagle icon, as well. Everything should be all set.

On changes, all of your edits will be automagically bundled for you. Just refresh the extension and the page you're testing on.

### Style

Make sure your text editor can use the .editorconfig file. For more, see [editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime). 

Run JSHint on everything, if possible.
