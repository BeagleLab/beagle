#CONTRIBUTING

This is the contribute.md for Beagle. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

## Core Team members

* [Richard Littauer](https://github.com/RichardLitt). Full stack developer and designer. Full time on the project, working remotely.
* Adam Marblestone, _MIT Media Lab_. PI on the project, part time. 
* [Juan Benet](https://github.com/jbenet/), _IPFS_. Project architect, part time. 

## Communication Channels

Most of the conversation around Beagle code occurs either in [beagle/issues](https://github.com/BeagleLab/beagle/issues), for low level implementation concerns, or in [voyage](https://github.com/BeagleLab/voyage), for longer term planning. We also often email - please ping us if you would like to be added to our internal email lists. Finally, you can hit us up at:

* IRC channel: #BeagleLab on freenode.
* Slack: Open an issue or ping @RichardLitt for an invite. 

## Adding new features

If you're interested in adding a new feature, please open an issue in https://github.com/BeagleLab/beagle/issues, and hack away. We're very welcoming.  We use [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) as a styleguide and linter for our Javascript; besides that, everything is pretty much up for grabs. To get set up, check out the README.md in this repository. 

You should include the following tests: _To Do. If you would like to help us set up a testing suite, please get in touch._                 

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around a day at most. 

## Bug triage

We don't currently have a complicated bug traiging system. Please file all of your bugs [here](https://github.com/BeagleLab/beagle/issues); if you would like to help us fix bugs, comment on an existing issue saying you're interested in tackling it and we'll do everything we can to help make that process easier for you. 

Filing a bug report is easy: simply open an issue. When you file, it is best if you explain _what_ happened, in what sort of environment (_where_) it happened, and what steps we could take to reproduce the issue (_how_). We'll work together to figure out the why. :) 

## Documentation

We're working on building out better documentation for this project. For now, here is a [screencast](https://www.screenmailer.com/v/jDCSGJmBaNZpVw4) of Richard going over the code, explaining how it was set up as of late April. If anything is unclear, please open an issue and ask for some clarification. 

## Community 

If you are not a developer, there is still a ton of help you can provide! Please get in touch, as we like to welcome new members of the community through a Google Hangout. 

We need beta testers. Early releases of any system, including Beagle, require heavy testing, and we would appreciate any feedback from users. 

If you're already familiar with Beagle, and want to do more than beta test:

* You can help us answer questions our users have.
* You can help build and design our website here.
* You can help write blog posts about the project by.
* You can help with newsletters and internal communications by.
* Create an example of the project in real world by building something or
showing what others have built. 
* Write about other people’s projects based on this project. Show how
it’s used in daily life. Take screenshots and make videos!

If you're interested in doing any of these, please get in touch.
